# react-three-next-demo

The goal of this app is to

* Learn and practice TypeScript, React.js, Next.js, React-three-fiber
* Display some sample borehole data positioned relative to a map, and with segments indicated
* Provide some interactions, at least some interactive data displays, maybe even networked sessions

## Progress

It's been challenging learning so many things at once and putting it all together. But I'm happy with the progress so far, after two days I have my app with the ability to load map textures for a given region, display them on a plane, set plane opacity with a slider, load sample borehole lithology data from a .csv file, and display it along with an interactive tooltip on hover.
